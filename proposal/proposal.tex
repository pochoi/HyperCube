\section{what you are trying to do, i.e., what are the questions you are trying to answer}

We would like to write a R package for the Hypercube estimators introduced by Rudolf Beran.


\section{For each of the following, enumerate specifics about which you might use}

\subsection{methods}

\subsection{techniques}
\subsection{software}
We use R.

\subsection{computational approaches (whichever are relevant)}

\section{Description}

We will implement the algorithms in the 


For the project proposal, I want approximately 2 - 3 paragraphs (no more than 3 or 1 page) that describes the project as you envisage
it now without having actually done the work. It should say
what you are trying to do, i.e., what are the questions you are trying to answer
For each of the following, enumerate specifics about which you might use
methods,
techniques,
software,
computational approaches (whichever are relevant)  
if there will be data involved, where are you getting them from and a brief overview what this contains.
what are the potential challenges/obstacles.
 
The description should serve as basic road-map  for what you will do.
It will allow me to understand
what is involved
how difficult or easy it will be and advise accordingly
suggest other approaches, techniques, ... you might consider
