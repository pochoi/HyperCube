\description{
A dataset containing the (average)  wight gain of an infant rat litter
when the infants in the litter are nursed by a rat foster-mother
}
\details{
The rat litter data treated by Scheffe (1959) form an unbalnced two-way layout
Each response recorded is the average weight-gain of a rat litter when the infants
in the litter are nursed by a rat foster-mother. Factor1 with four levels, is the
genotype of the foster-moather. Factor2 with the same levels, in the genotype of the
infant litter.

The response measured in the experiment is the (average) weight gain
of an infant rat litter when the infants in the litter are nursed by a rat foster-mother.
Factor 1 is the genotype of the foster-mother nursing the infants.
Factor 2 is the genotype of the infant litter.
