It looks like this package (or one of its dependent packages) has an
unstated dependence on a standard package.  All dependencies must be
declared in DESCRIPTION.
See section ‘The DESCRIPTION file’ in the ‘Writing R Extensions’
manual.

A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
session will be unable to start.

Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
