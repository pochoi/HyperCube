\description{
A dataset containing the response measures the hardness of dental filling
obtained by 5 Dentists using 8 Gold alloys and 3 Condensation methods.
The objective of the experiment was to find a dental gold filling with greater hardness.

\details{
Seheult and Tukey (2001) analyzed a three-factor layout in which the response measures
the hardness of dental fillings obtained by 5 Dentists (D) using 8 Gold alloys (G) and
3 Condensation methods (C). The objective of the experiment was to find a dental gold
lling with greater hardness. Condensation, properly carried out, was known to increase
the hardness of a filling. The three condensation techniques used in the experiment were:
  (1) electromalleting, in which blows are delivered mechanically at a steady frequency; (2)
hand malleting, in which a small mallet is used to deliver blows; and (3) hand condensation.
The reported hardness observations are each averages of ten measurements that are not
available. It was reported anecdotally that dentist 5 appeared to be physically tired before
the experiment.
