\description{
A dataset containing 133 observation of motorsycle
acceleration against time in a simulated motorcycle accident.
The p = 277 possible observation times constitute the vector t = (1, 2, ... , 277)
Accelerations were observed at only q < p of these equally spaced time,
sometimes with replication.
